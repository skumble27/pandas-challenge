## Data Analytics undertaken within the PyCity District

##### Sumukh Kumble

### Introduction

At the request of the Mayor of PyCity, students performances in standardized tests in Mathematics and Reading will help determine the performances of each school as well as the overall performances of the district relative to the amount of funding each school receives, which in turn, should fascilitate in executing future priorities as well as budget allocation. Several metrics of assessment have been implemented and presented below.

### Data Analysis Summary

Several metrics were applied in analysing school performances. As seen in the first analysis of the overall performances of schools within the district, it can be deduced that the overall pass rate for both mathematics and reading is roughly 50% of the students who undertook both standardized tests.  Upon further analyses of scores based on individual schools, the top performing schools have demonstrate that roughly 90% of their students have passed in both the mathematics and reading tests, whereas only the 50% of the students have been in the bottom performing school. Taking these into consideration, there appears to be a trend wherein the schools that receive higher per student budgeting appear to have a much lower overall pass rate, in addition to schools that have a higher number of students enrolled in their institutions. Furthermore, a major distinction in the rate of students passing both tests appears to be greater in Charter Schools in comparison to the District Schools, therefore, in summary, the following colorations appear to influence students performances, which are:

​	1) School Size

​	2) Budget per Student

​	3) Charter Schools having a higher overall pass rate.
